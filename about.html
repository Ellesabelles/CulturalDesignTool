        <h1>About the Tool</h1>
            This tool is part of a class project for the International User Experience And Communication class taught by Professor Noske at <a href="https://www.hcde.washington.edu/ms">University of Washington's Human-Centered Design & Engineering Master's program</a>. In this class, we study how to use research methods to develop insight into other cultures, and how design choices can be informed by an understanding of diverse cultures. One of the tools that we used in this class was the "Cultural Dimensions Theory" of Geert Hofstede and subsequent authors who built upon his theories. Cultural dimensions theory seeks to isolate specific paradigms in culture and compare them across national boundaries so that certain aspects of behavior and cognition can be more deeply understood.
